Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

========
题目的意思是啥呢？就是数组nums中的元素个数大于n/2个是，那该元素就是主要元素

class Solution(object):
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        cout = collections.Counter(nums)
        for i in cout.keys():
            if cout[i] > len(nums)//2:
                return i
